## PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE
The program is written solely in java, html and css.
All new or additional code has to be written in one 
of these languages.

### TESTING
If you are unsure of whether new methods work, 
make sure to create an efficient amount of unittest 
and/or integrationtests before pushing to GitHub.

### PACKAGING
The classes are all placed in relevant folders 
and directories according to the MVC principal.
All new classes you may create will have to be 
placed in one of these directories.

### COMMIT MESSAGES
When committing make sure to write a commit message
that explains the changes you have made to the code,
so that future developers can look through the
commit history and see when which changes were implemented.

*Do not write commit messages that are longer than a few sentences.*

### CODE STRUCTURE
The java code is written according to SRP -
**Single Responsibility Principal**. All new code has to follow the same principal.
The methods can therefore not have more than single function/responsibility.
If a method needs to do two or more different things then make a help-method.
